# üîß Troubleshooting Guide

There may be various issues you can run into while setting this up. Here are some tips on troubleshooting:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues

**Server Disconnected**:
```
MCP cw-mcp-server: Server Disconnected.
```
1. Ensure your json file in the [ai integration guide](./ai-integration.md) is configured properly.
2. Ensure you've set up your AWS credentials properly according to the [aws configuration](./aws-config.md)

**Authentication Errors**:
```
Error: An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the DescribeLogGroups operation: Access denied
```
Ensure your AWS credentials are properly configured and have the necessary permissions to access CloudWatch Logs.

**Resource Not Found**:
```
Error: An error occurred (ResourceNotFoundException) when calling the GetLogEvents operation
```
Check that the log group and stream names are correct. Log stream names are case sensitive.

**Connection Issues**:
```
Error: Failed to connect to MCP server
```
Verify that the server is running and accessible. Check file paths in your `claude_desktop_config.json` or client configuration.

**Query Timeout**:
```
"status": "Timeout", "error": "Search query failed to complete"
```
For complex queries or large log volumes, try reducing the time range using the `--hours` parameter.

**Claude terminating request**:

This could be due to a query timeout or invalid response from CloudWatch (for example: performing operations on a non-existent log group). 

In this case, try checking the server logs as outlined in the settings

![Claude Desktop Settings](./assets/claude-desktop-settings.png)

then, click on the `Open Logs Folder` and open the `mcp-server-cw-mcp-server.log` file to see more details.
